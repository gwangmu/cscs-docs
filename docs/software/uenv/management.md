# Managing uenvs

This page documents how to search for, download and manage your local uenv images.

Uenv are fully self-contained environments stored in a [SquashFS](https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/squashfs.html) file, that have to be downloaded to a local file system before they can be used.
The `uenv` command line tool provides features for finding uenv that are available, downloading them and searching local uenv.

The commands and their relationship with repositories and registries can be illustrated:

![uenv management workflow](../../images/uenv/uenv-store.png)

In the above image there are two locations where uenv images are stored:

- The CSCS uenv **registry** is a server that hosts uenv images, that can be access from all clusters on Alps.
  The images in the registry include:
    * officially supported uenv images provided by CSCS for users on Alps;
    * and, images built by users using the [uenv build][ref-uenv-build] service.
- A **repository** (or repo) is a directory on the file system that contains downloaded uenv.
  See the [repository][ref-uenv-repo] documentation for more information.

## Finding and downloading uenv

[](){#ref-uenv-image-find}
### `uenv image find`
The uenv images are in a registry can be queried using the `uenv image find` command:

!!! example  "uenv image find"
    ```console
    $ uenv image find
    uenv                       arch  system  id                size(MB)  date

    ```

The output above lists all of the uenv that are available on the current system ([Eiger][ref-cluster-eiger] in this case).

The search can be refined by providing a [label][ref-uenv-labels].

??? example "Using labels to refine search"
    ```bash
    # find all uenv with name prgenv-gnu
    uenv image find prgenv-gnu

    # find all uenv with name and version prgenv-gnu/24.11
    uenv image find prgenv-gnu/24.11

    # find all uenv available for daint
    uenv image find @daint

    # find all prgenv-gnu uenv available on a cluster
    uenv image find prgenv-gnu@daint

    # find all uenv in the service namespace with name myenv
    uenv image find service::myenv
    ```

!!! info
    All uenv commands that take a [label][ref-uenv-labels] as an argument use the same flexible syntax [label descriptions][ref-uenv-labels-examples].

[](){#ref-uenv-image-pull}
### `uenv image pull`

To download a uenv so that you can use it, use the `uenv image pull` command to download it from the registry to your local [repository][ref-uenv-repo].
For example, to download a version of the `prgenv-gnu` uenv:

!!! example "uenv image pull"
    ```bash
    # The following commands have the same effect

    # method 1: pull using the name of the uenv
    uenv image pull prgenv-gnu/24.2:v1

    # method 2: pull using the id of the image
    uenv image pull 3ea1945046d884ee
    ```

Some images can be large, over 10 GB, and it can take a while to download them from the registry.

[](){#ref-uenv-restricted-software}
### Accessing restricted software

By default, uenv can be pulled by all users on a system, with no restrictions.

Some uenv are not available to all users, for example the `vasp` images are only available for users with a [VASP][ref-uenv-vasp] license, who are added to the `vasp` group once they have provided CSCS with a copy of their license.

To be able to pull such images a token that authorizes access must be provided.
Tokens are created by CSCS, and stored on SCRATCH in a file that only users who have access to the software can read.

!!! example  "using a token to access VASP"
    ```bash
    uenv image pull \
        --token=/capstor/scratch/cscs/bcumming/tokens/vasp6 \
        --username=vasp6 \
        vasp/v6.4.3:v1
    ```

!!! note
    As of June 2025, the only restricted software is VASP.

!!! note
    Better token management is under development - tokens will be stored in a central location and will be easier to use.

## Managing local images

[](){#ref-uenv-image-ls}
### `uenv image ls`

To view all uenv that are available and ready to run from your repo, use the `uenv image ls` command:

!!! example "listing downloaded uenv"
    ```console
    $ uenv image ls

    ```

    You can apply filters, for example show only uenv with the name `prgenv-gnu`:

    ```console
    $ uenv image ls prgenv-gnu
    uenv                           arch   system  id                size(MB)  date

    ```

    Or only uenv with the tag `v3`:

    ```console
    $ uenv image ls :v1
    uenv                           arch   system  id                size(MB)  date
    namd/3.0:v3                    gh200  daint   49bc65c6905eb5da   4,028    2024-12-12
    prgenv-gnu/24.7:v3             gh200  daint   b50ca0d101456970   3,859    2024-08-23
    ```

!!! example "filtering downloaded uenv"

This command will show you all images that have been downloaded to your repo, and labelled for the current cluster.
The examples above were executed on [Daint][ref-cluster-daint] (see the `system` column in the output).
To view all images that are available for all clusters:

```console
$ uenv image ls @*
```

[](){#ref-uenv-image-rm}
### `uenv image rm`

To remove downloaded images from your repo, use the `uenv image rm` command.

!!! example "removing uenv from a repo"
    In the following examples
    ```console
    $ uenv image ls
    uenv                             arch   system  id                size(MB)  date

[](){#ref-uenv-image-add}
### `uenv image add`

To add a uenv SquashFS file to a repo, so that it can be used with a [label][ref-uenv-labels], use the `uenv image add` command.

!!! example "add an image to the default repo"
    ```console
    $ uenv image add myenv/24.7:v1@eiger%zen2 ./store.squashfs
    ```

    Note that the [label][ref-uenv-labels] must be of the complete `name/version:tag@system%uarch` form.

[](){#ref-uenv-repo}
## Repositories

A repository is a directory that contains an sqlite database `index.db` in the root, and an `images` sub-directory that contains the individual uenv that have been downloaded in directories.

```
repo
├── index.db
└── images
    ├── 01ed...a5ab
    │   └── store.squashfs
    ├── 0b6a...24c1
    │   └── store.squashfs
    └── 1528...785a
        └── store.squashfs
```

### Creating and using repositories

A repo will automatically be created in your [Scratch path][ref-storage-scratch] attached to the cluster you are on when you first use uenv.
This _default repo_ is used by all calls to uenv, unless it is overridden using the options in this section.

!!! question "Where is my repo?"
    The Scratch filesystem used depends on the cluster:

    | cluster | repo path | notes |
    | ------- | --------- | ----- |
    | Eiger, Daint | `/capstor/scratch/cscs/$USER/.uenv-images` | will move to `/ritom/scratch/cscs/$USER/.uenv-images` when it replaces capstor in December 2025|
    | Santis       | `/capstor/scratch/cscs/$USER/.uenv-images` |       |
    | Clariden     | `/iopsstor/scratch/cscs/$USER/.uenv-images` |       |
    | Others       | `$SCRATCH/.uenv-images` | `$HOME/.uenv/repo` on systems with no `SCRATCH` defined. |

The location of your default repo can be changed by setting the `repo` field in the [uenv config file][ref-uenv-configure-options-repo].
For example, the following would use a shared repo in a project's [Store][ref-storage-store]:
```
repo = /capstor/store/cscs/userlab/sm42/team-uenv
```

The `--repo` flag can also be used to use a specific repo on the command line, for example to list all uenv in the repo ``/capstor/store/cscs/userlab/sm42/team-uenv`:

```console
$ uenv --repo=/capstor/store/cscs/userlab/sm42/team-uenv image ls
```
Note that the `--repo` flag goes between `uenv` and the command, `image ls` in the example above, and can be used with all uenv commands.

[](){#ref-uenv-repo-status}
### `uenv repo status`

The `uenv repo status` command provides information about a repository.
By default, `uenv repo status` will print information about the default repo.
To get the status of a different repo, provide it as an optional positional argument:

!!! example ""
    ```console
    $ uenv repo status
    the repository /capstor/scratch/cscs/bcumming/.uenv-images is readwrite
      - on a lustre file system

    $ ./uenv repo status $HOME/.uenv/repo
    the repository /users/bcumming/.uenv/repo is readwrite
    ```

The information provided includes:

* the location of the repository;
* whether the repository is read only or writable;
* and, whether the repository is on a lustre file system.

Warnings are printed if:

* the repo is on a Lustre file system and contains unstriped images;
* the repo is in inconsistent state;
* or, if the repo database needs updating.

If a warning is printed, it is possible to fix the issues by running the [`repo update`][ref-uenv-repo-update] command.

??? question "what is an inconsistent repo?"
    A repository is inconsistent if one or more uenv images have been removed without updating the database.
    This should not happen to repositories in the default location, which are protected from [cleanup policies][ref-storage-cleanup].
    However, if you are using a non-standard location, infrequently used images may be removed by Scratch cleanup.
    Images can sometimes be removed manually/accidentally.

[](){#ref-uenv-repo-update}
### `uenv repo update`

The repo update command can upgrade or fix issues in a repository, if needed.
Currently two updates are applied:

- apply Lustre striping if the repo is on a Lustre file system and no striping has already been applied;
- remove uenv from the database if their squashfs file does not exist which can occur to repos on non-default locations that are subject to clean up policies.

```console
# apply all updates to the default repo
$ uenv repo update

# only apply consistency fixes and database updates to the default repo
$ uenv repo update --no-lustre

# apply updates to a non-default repo location
$ uenv repo update /capstor/scratch/cscs/$USER/my-other-repo
```

!!! note "Lustre striping"
    uenv 9.1.0 applies Lustre striping to new repositories by default.
    Striping only needs to be applied once to repos created with older versions, and only has to be applied once.

    As a general rule, striping is only needed for workloads that run at very large scale, on hundreds of nodes.

    Applying striping can take over 10 minutes for larger repositories.
    Use the `--no-lustre` option if you only want to fix inconsistencies.

[](){#ref-uenv-repo-migrate}
### `uenv repo migrate`

The repo migrate command copies a repository to a new location.

There are two main use cases:

1. copying a repo to a new location;
2. and, updating a target repo to include all images from another repo.

The command takes two arguments, a source and destination repo:
```
$ uenv repo migrate [source] [destination]
```

If the destination repo does not exist, it is created and a populated with a complete copy of the source repo.
Otherwise, all images from the source are copied into destination, with only missing images copied (effectively synchronizing the destination with the source).

If only one argument is passed, the default repo is used as the source.

!!! warning
    Migration of large repos can take a significant amount of time - budget roughly 30 minutes.
    If migration is cancelled by the user, or by a system issue, it can be resumed with the same command, which will continue from where the migration was when canceled.

#### Migration to Ritom

In March-April 2026 the Scratch filesystem on Daint and Eiger will be moved to a newly-installed filesystem called Ritom.
The default repository location will change from `/capstor/scratch/cscs/$USER/.uenv-images` to `/ritom/scratch/cscs/$USER/.uenv-images`.
There is a transition period, during which it is possible to use both Capstor and Ritom, and a message like the following will be shown by uenv when it is time to migrate:

??? example "uenv migration message"
    ```
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    warning: the default uenv repo on this system has moved to a new location:
      /iopsstor/scratch/cscs/bcumming/.uenv-images
    Migrate your repo, while the old location is still available, with this command:
      uenv repo migrate --sync /capstor/scratch/cscs/<user>/.uenv-images \
                               /ritom/scratch/cscs/<user>/.uenv-images
    Migration can take over 30 minutes, and must be completed fully after it has
    been started for all of the original images to be available. If interrupted,
    migration can be resumed using the same command.
    note: uenv will continue using the old location and printing this warning until
    the migration is performed.
    Set the environment variable UENV_WARN_MIGRATE to silence this warning.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ```

The migration message is currently disabled, because we are not ready to migrate uenv for the reasons explained below.

If the migration is interrupted, the new default repository will not contain all uenv images, and you will need to finish the migration by running the same command again.

!!! warning "Ritom is not ready for storing uenv"
    Ritom is currently mounted on Daint and Eiger, however it was mounted with [squash root](https://www.opswat.com/docs/mdss/integrations/what-is-user-squashing-for-network-file-system-nfs) enabled, which makes the **uenv Slurm plugin hang when starting jobs with uenv images stored on Ritom**.

    CSCS are testing a new version of uenv (`v9.2.0`) that makes uenv compatible with file systems with squash root enabled, that we plan to deploy on March 25th 2026.

    If you were using uenv before ritom was mounted, uenv will continue using the repository on Capstor until a migration has been performed. However, new users of uenv and some users who saw the migration message will need to make Capstor their default repository location until the fix has been deployed.

    If the system you are using has v9.2.0 installed, there is no need to apply this fix, and you should submit a support request if your issue persists.

    ```console title="version too old"
    $ uenv --version
    9.1.0
    ```

    ```console title="all good: 9.2.0 and later are fixed"
    $ uenv --version
    9.2.0
    ```

    If you migrated the default repository from Capstor to Ritom, the old repository on Capstor was not deleted.
    The easiest fix is to remove the Ritom repository, so that uenv falls back to using Capstor.

    First, check whether the old repository on Capstor scratch exists:

    !!! example "Checking whether there is a repository on Capstor"

        ```console title="no repository on Capstor"
        $ uenv repo status /capstor/scratch/cscs/$USER/.uenv-images
        /capstor/scratch/cscs/bcumming/.uenv-images is not a repository
        ```

        ```console title="there is an existing repository on Capstor"
        $ uenv repo status /capstor/scratch/cscs/$USER/.uenv-images
        the repository /capstor/scratch/cscs/bcumming/.uenv-images is readwrite
        - on a lustre file system
        ```

    If there is no repository on Capstor, first create one (skip this step if one already exists).

    ```console title="create a repository on Capstor"
    $ uenv repo create $SCRATCH/.uenv-images
    ```

    Then remove the repository on ritom, while keeping a copy of it:

    ```console
    $ mv /ritom/scratch/cscs/$USER/.uenv-images /ritom/scratch/cscs/$USER/.uenv-images.back
    ```

    If the move was successful, then the `uenv repo status` command will show location of the default repository on `/capstor/scratch`:
